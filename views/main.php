                    kids, and what better opportunity to sit and read a story — one that’s not fake. It’s not a dreaming story
                    – it’s not Harry Potter. It’s a real-life story, with glorious moments to horrific moments, including the 
                    frostbite — and what better way to show kids their potential than with a real-life story? </p>

                <p class="hidden-xs-down">The ASICS Snapdown 2 is the new and improved version of the Snapdown, the 
                    ultimate mid-level wrestling shoe. Perhaps you’ve been wrestling for a little while now, and it’s 
                    time to replace that first pair that you either outgrew or wore out in a matter of weeks. If so, 
                    this is for you. The Snapdown 2 features a full-length solid outsole, that is flexible, while providing
                    wrestling-specific traction in key areas for better control on the mat. This new outsole design was 
                    made to be incredibly low-profile, while providing superior grip.</p>

                        a large team order for these singlets. Some of the singlets are sold out at ASICS and not available
