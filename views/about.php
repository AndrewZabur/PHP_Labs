        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Started in 2018, Wrestling Team Shop quickly established itself as a high quality shop with good stuff. Here
            at Wrestling Team Shop we work directly with some of the greatest wrestlers in history. By allowing wrestlers 
            to create their own stores it gives you, the fans, the opportunity to own t-shirts you have seen at competitions,
            in pictures or may have never seen before. All stores, products and photos are owned by the wrestlers themselves.
            Profits go directly to the wrestlers to support what they do and what you love.</p>
        <p>Our shop successfully provides different goods, from wrestling shoe & singlet to many other wrestling things such as 
            ropes, mats and different specific equipment.</p>

                            freestyle wrestler and gold medalist from the 2012 London Olympic Games, to a five-year deal. With the 
                            signing, the brand has released two pairs of sneakers with the help of Burroughs, available now. For the 
                            wrestler looking for a shoe ready for competition, the brand created the JB Elite V2.0 wrestling shoe, built 
                            with the comfort and fit required by Burroughs in mind. This second generation wrestling shoe received updates
                            based on Burroughs’ own specifications for optimal comfort and fit. The second edition of the shoe features a 
                            Split Sole design with wrestling-specific “serradial” traction pods, built for flexibility and traction, and a 
                            redesigned upper with a breathable single-layer mesh body. The JB Elite V2.0 has a retail price of $80 and is 
                            available in three colorways. </p>

                            <p class="ml-2 hidden-xs-down">The Adidas AdiZero 2 wrestling shoe is quite possibly the best sequel in wrestling 
                            shoe history. We weren’t sure how Adidas was going to one-up the wildly popular and amazingly comfortable 
                            version 1 of the Varner, but they’ve worked their magic and completely blown us away with this new release. The
                            Varner 2 has kept and improved upon the features everyone loved about the original, and reimagined the certain 
                            design aspects that were holding it back from true greatness. As the name implies, this is the signature shoe of
                            Olympic Gold Medalist Jake Varner. As such, Adidas designed this shoe around his wrestling style, and used his 
                            input to create one of the best elite-level wrestling shoes ever.</p>

                            5 GS is the updated kid’s version of the Matflex 5. It delivers all the same great comfort and support that 
                            Matflex fans have come to expect over the years. It comes with a Full length rubber outsole for great traction from
                            any angle. The upper is made of a lightweight but durable mesh that provides extra breathability. One major design
                            change from the Matflex 4 GS was going back to a laced enclosure, instead of Velcro straps. This will ensure that 
                            every youth wrestler is getting secure fit in a  wrestling shoe that they need.</p>
